    <h3 id="Heli_Dhauladhar">The Dhauladhar Heli Project</h3>
    <p>
      In the past years, we have seen that the rescue operations are mostly conducted by Private helicopters that the locals arrange. It is in only rare cases that the Indian Air Force, who get the request from the official sources and then deploy their helicopters and rescue teams.  Bircom wants to make very serious effort to be able to bridge this gap so that the time taken between the need for rescue., and the time it takes for the helicopters from the Indian Air Force to arrive can get reduced . Very often the people who need the rescue have got Insurance cover to pay for this rescue. In such situations, the Indian force can get reimbursed for the cost of the rescue.  We are going to make an effort to study this whole problem and find a solution. The community have been talking about this. The whole of 2024, and some very nice sessions and community support is available. 
    </p>

    
    <h3 id="Mesh_Hindi">Meshtastic in Hindi</h3>
    <p>
      The Meshtastic App that is used on the Smart Phones has a project working so that it can be translated into other languages. Support for many of them is already there. They want people who are comfortable in other languages to also help in the translation work. We want to help in the process.
    </p>

    <h3 id="Mesh_Maintainence">Mesh Maintainence</h3>
    <p>

      The experience from the time we have been operating this network, the most easy thing has been to make the devices and have them put into the locations that are suitable. However, the more difficult part has been to be able to keep servicing them in terms of upgrading their software. Ensuring that the device is still clean and standing in its right position, because some of them are in snowbound areas. This is an ongoing project.
    </p>

        <h3 id="Tech_Infra">Everything Infrastructure</h3>
    <p>
      The location data transmitted by the various personal devices in the reach of the various hubs, either directly or through the mesh network, has to be stored so that information about the location of persons in need of rescue can be determined. Also, the information has to be shared between the pilots flying in the area. The tracker website needs constant looking after. For this reasonable amount of structure is required in the cloud. Also, there is a great need for volunteers who have the knowledge., to keep the systems running. This is an ongoing project and needs a lot of resources and manpower.
    </p>

        <h3 id="Fund_Raising">The Fund Raisers.</h3>
    <p>
      The entire efforts of this whole enterprise is non-profit. Therefore, to keep things going and to pay for the costs of certain resources and manpower that has to be bought funds are required.  We need our partners to help out on the strategies necessary to keep the donations to the cause flowing.
    </p>

        <h3 id="Social_Media">The Social Media.</h3>
    <p>
      The efforts of fundraising and the great need to spread the awareness of the structures available and also the how to use of using the devices, on how to do it yourself, on the translations for the Meshtastic app,  there is a good requirement for making this enterprise known to people over the internet. Partners can help to generate these social media content and to manage.  A team is needed to guide and move this effort forward.  Bircom would be also required to fund these efforts, so partners please come along and help.
    </p>

        <h3 id="Assest_Protection">Protection of Assets</h3>
    <p>
      The various repeaters and hubs that are located in remote mountainous areas, and many on top of hilltop temples are physically expensive and require to be protected. These assets of the foundation can only be protected if we get the support of the local government authorities.  In which area we require some partners to keep their liaison with Local authorities and police.
